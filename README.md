# WS2812 UNO USB

Control WS2812 RGB LED trough USB using an Arduino Uno's Serial interface
====================================
You'll need to connect the data pin of WS2812 to PIN 6 of your Arduino Uno
In order to use the simple client, you'll need python, and you should change the serial line according to your system
====================================
The client was made, because I couldn't get programs like PuTTY to work with arduino's serial interface
